# Data_Capstone_205
In my endeavor to acquire my Data science certificate at Montgomery College, I completed the capstone project. The purpose of my project was to gain more insight into traffic violations that occurred in Montgomery County. While doing so, I discovered a few interesting facts and learned valuable skills such as data mining. This project was my pleasure, and I hope you are intrigued.
