# Data_Capstone_205
In my endeavor to acquire my Data science certificate at Montgomery College, I successfully completed the data science capstone project. The purpose of my capstone project was to gain deeper insight on traffic violations that occurred in Montgomery County. While doing so, I discovered a few interesting facts and learned valuable skills in data mining. This project was my pleasure, and I hope you are intrigued.
